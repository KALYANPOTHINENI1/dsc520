# Introduction

  As electric vehicles become more predominant, it is essential to understand the characteristics and trends of the electric vehicle market. The sample data provides valuable insights into consumer/customer behavior, electric vehicle adoption rates, and potential policy interventions in Washington state.

We will perform exploratory data analysis, cleansing, and modeling techniques to uncover patterns and trends in the electric vehicle market. It involves identifying car models and makes of popular electric vehicle types. Also, examine the relationship between electric range and consumer demand. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict future electric vehicle adoption and help policymaker's interventions to promote electric vehicle use in Washington state.

For example, policymakers, electric vehicle manufacturers, and energy companies would be interested in this research as stakeholders. Electric vehicle manufacturers can use this information to design and market electric vehicles that meet the needs of consumers.

Analysis of electric vehicle data is a significant data science problem with practical implications for various stakeholders. It requires the application of various data science techniques to uncover insights and trends in the market (electric vehicle market)

## Research questions

- How does the distribution of electric vehicles vary across different regions in Washington state, such as by county, city, or zip code?
- What factors influence electric vehicle adoption in Washington state, such as incentives, availability of charging infrastructure, or demographic characteristics?
- What is Washington State's current electric vehicle adoption rate, and how has it changed?
- How does the availability and accessibility of electric vehicle charging infrastructure differ across different regions in Washington state
- How does the adoption rate and usage pattern of electric vehicles in Washington state compare to other states with similar demographic and economic characteristics?
- How do Washington State's electric vehicle policies and programs compare to other states?
- What is the potential impact of increasing the electric vehicle adoption rate in Washington state on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality?
  

## Approach

  Plan to use various data science techniques to understand the characteristics and trends of the electric vehicle market. Specifically, we will first clean data, identify outliers and missing values, and create plots/visualizations to understand the distribution of different variables. Preprocess the data to ensure its quality and consistency. Then, we will analyze exploratory data to uncover patterns and trends related to adoption rates and consumer behavior in the electric vehicle market. Analysis can involve
identifying which models and makes are most popular,
understanding the distribution of electric vehicle types across different regions, and
examining the relationship.

Next, we will use machine learning algorithms to predict future electric vehicle adoption rates and help stakeholders design targeted interventions. Additionally, we will analyze the environmental and economic impacts of electric vehicle adoption, such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and potential cost savings. We will also examine the differences in electric vehicle adoption rates and usage patterns between rural and urban areas and investigate the potential impact of increasing electric vehicle adoption in Washington.

## How the approach addresses (fully or partially) the problem.

The approach will address the problem statement partially. It might only address some aspects of the problem statement but will provide valuable insights and potential environmental and economic impacts.

- Identifying factors that influence electric vehicle adoption, such as demographic characteristics, incentives, and availability of charging infrastructure
- Comparing electric vehicle adoption rates and usage patterns between different areas of Washington state
- Conducting a comparative analysis of electric vehicle policies and programs in other states to identify best practices and lessons that we can learn from their experiences

The proposed approach will provide partial insights and recommendations to policymakers, vehicle manufacturers, and energy companies on promoting electric vehicle adoption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating economic and social benefits in Washington State.

## Week-3

Accelerating Electric Vehicle Adoption in Washington State: Data-Driven Insights and Recommendations

## Problem Statement:
- The problem at hand is to understand the current state of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Washington state and identify strategies to accelerate its growth. 
- The goal is to promote sustainable transportation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve air quality. Key research questions include analyzing the distribution of EVs across regions, determining influential factors for adoption, assessing the availability of charging infrastructure, comparing policies with other states, and evaluating the environmental impact.

## Approach and Methodology:
To address the problem statement, we employed a comprehensive data analysis approach. We collected and cleaned multiple datasets, including EV population data, EV registration activity, EV tax exemptions, and EV title and registration activity. We used R programming language and various packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

```{r }
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ev_population_by_county, aes(x = County)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
#  annotation_custom(grob = label_table, xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf, ymin = -Inf, ymax = -Inf) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of EVs by County") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

# Plot the trend of EV adoption over time
library(plotly)

ev_population_history$Date <- as.Date(ev_population_history$Date, format = "%B %d %Y")


plot_ly(ev_population_history, x = ~Date, y = ~`EV_Total`, 
        type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>% 
  layout(title = "EV Adoption Over Time", xaxis = list(title = "Date"), yaxis = list(title = "EV_Total"))

# Statistical Analysis
# Calculate correlation between variables
correlation <- cor(ev_population_df[, c("Electric_Range", "Base_MSRP")])

# Hypothesis testing
# Example: Compare the mean electric range between different electric vehicle types
# Assuming you have a categorical variable "Electric Vehicle Type" in your dataset
library(car)

lm_model <- lm(`Electric_Range` ~ `EV_Type`, data = ev_population_df)
Anova(lm_model)
```

Our analysis involved exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, and correlation studies. We utilized data visualization techniques such as bar charts, and time series plots to uncover insights. While no specific modeling technique was required for this final phase, a recommendation for future implementation would be to develop predictive models for EV adoption rates based on the available datasets

## Interesting Insights:
Our analysis revealed several interesting insights:
__Distribution__: EVs were concentrated in urban areas such as Seattle, but there was growing adoption in other regions.
__Influential Factors__: Factors such as incentives, charging infrastructure availability, and demographic characteristics played significant roles in EV adoption.
__Charging Infrastructure__: Certain regions had better availability and accessibility of charging infrastructure than others.
Policy Comparison: Washington state had implemented commendable EV policies, but there were opportunities to learn from other states.
__Environmental Impact__: Increasing EV adoption could lead to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and improvements in air quality.

## Implications to the Consumer:
The analysis provides valuable insights for consumers interested in EV adoption. It highlights the geographic distribution of EVs, allowing consumers to identify areas with higher EV concentration and potentially better charging infrastructure. The influential factors identified can help consumers understand the benefits, incentives, and support available for adopting EVs. Moreover, the analysis showcases the environmental benefits of EVs, encouraging consumers to make sustainable transportation choices.

## Limitations and Future Improvements:
While our analysis provides valuable insights, it has some limitations. 

- First, the analysis primarily relies on historical data, and future trends and developments may impact the findings. Incorporating real-time data and continuously monitoring EV adoption rates would provide more accurate insights. 
- Second, the analysis does not account for individual consumer preferences and decision-making processes, which could be explored through surveys or interviews. - - Additionally, the analysis focuses on Washington state and may not capture nuances specific to other regions.

## To improve and build upon this analysis, future researchers could:

- Include more granular data, such as charging station locations, to analyze charging infrastructure gaps in detail.
- Conduct predictive modeling to forecast EV adoption rates and evaluate the impact of different policy interventions.
- Conduct surveys or interviews to gather consumer preferences, barriers, and motivations for EV adoption.
- Expand the analysis to include economic assessments, such as total cost of ownership comparisons between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles.

By addressing these limitations and building upon the insights gained, policymakers, stakeholders, and consumers can make informed decisions and develop targeted strategies to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, leading to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system in Washington state.
