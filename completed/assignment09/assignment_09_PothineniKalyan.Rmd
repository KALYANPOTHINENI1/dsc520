# Introduction

  As electric vehicles become more predominant, it is essential to understand the characteristics and trends of the electric vehicle market. The sample data provides valuable insights into consumer/customer behavior, electric vehicle adoption rates, and potential policy interventions in Washington state.

We will perform exploratory data analysis, cleansing, and modeling techniques to uncover patterns and trends in the electric vehicle market. It involves identifying car models and makes of popular electric vehicle types. Also, examine the relationship between electric range and consumer demand. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict future electric vehicle adoption and help policymaker's interventions to promote electric vehicle use in Washington state.

For example, policymakers, electric vehicle manufacturers, and energy companies would be interested in this research as stakeholders. Electric vehicle manufacturers can use this information to design and market electric vehicles that meet the needs of consumers.

Analysis of electric vehicle data is a significant data science problem with practical implications for various stakeholders. It requires the application of various data science techniques to uncover insights and trends in the market (electric vehicle market)

## Research questions

- How does the distribution of electric vehicles vary across different regions in Washington state, such as by county, city, or zip code?
- What factors influence electric vehicle adoption in Washington state, such as incentives, availability of charging infrastructure, or demographic characteristics?
- What is Washington State's current electric vehicle adoption rate, and how has it changed?
- How does the availability and accessibility of electric vehicle charging infrastructure differ across different regions in Washington state
- How does the adoption rate and usage pattern of electric vehicles in Washington state compare to other states with similar demographic and economic characteristics?
- How do Washington State's electric vehicle policies and programs compare to other states?
- What is the potential impact of increasing the electric vehicle adoption rate in Washington state on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality?
  

## Approach

  Plan to use various data science techniques to understand the characteristics and trends of the electric vehicle market. Specifically, we will first clean data, identify outliers and missing values, and create plots/visualizations to understand the distribution of different variables. Preprocess the data to ensure its quality and consistency. Then, we will analyze exploratory data to uncover patterns and trends related to adoption rates and consumer behavior in the electric vehicle market. Analysis can involve
identifying which models and makes are most popular,
understanding the distribution of electric vehicle types across different regions, and
examining the relationship.

Next, we will use machine learning algorithms to predict future electric vehicle adoption rates and help stakeholders design targeted interventions. Additionally, we will analyze the environmental and economic impacts of electric vehicle adoption, such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and potential cost savings. We will also examine the differences in electric vehicle adoption rates and usage patterns between rural and urban areas and investigate the potential impact of increasing electric vehicle adoption in Washington.

## How the approach addresses (fully or partially) the problem.

The approach will address the problem statement partially. It might only address some aspects of the problem statement but will provide valuable insights and potential environmental and economic impacts.

- Identifying factors that influence electric vehicle adoption, such as demographic characteristics, incentives, and availability of charging infrastructure
- Comparing electric vehicle adoption rates and usage patterns between different areas of Washington state
- Conducting a comparative analysis of electric vehicle policies and programs in other states to identify best practices and lessons that we can learn from their experiences

The proposed approach will provide partial insights and recommendations to policymakers, vehicle manufacturers, and energy companies on promoting electric vehicle adoption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating economic and social benefits in Washington State.
